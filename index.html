            <p>Thank you for checking out my website. It's my goal that God be glorified and magnified through my writings, my preaching, and my teaching. I hope that is your goal in reading some of my work. Take a look at my blog, see what's going on at Open Door Baptist Church, or take a look at Carolina University where I teach.
            <br><br>
            In His grasp,
            <br><br>
            Tim White.
